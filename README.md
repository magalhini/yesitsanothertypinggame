# Yes, It's Another Typing Game

A dead simple typing game where you race against time writing a word at a time.
You can use it to calculate your WPM (Words Per Minute) score and also to practice typing fast without making any typos, as you lose points (time) for each mistake made.

You can play it here:

## Why another typing game?

I never meant to make this project, as I was merely experimenting with both the Hilitor library and Foundation's Flexbox grid... the two of them simply came together into this, 5 minutes at a time over a few days!

## Webpack, Hot Reloading, so much for a single ES6 Class game...?

Yes, I like overkilling my side projects. Don't judge, just keep typing.
